Hi Everyone,

- Once again, a new project for those who are a step above beginner.  The attached .zip SystemVerilog test-bench was tested in Altera ModelSim 10 & 20, but contains no Altera specific code.  It should work in any ModelSim.

See original project page listing from Jan 28m 2021 located here:

https://www.eevblog.com/forum/fpga/systemverilog-example-testbench-which-saves-a-bmp-picture-and-executes-a-script/

- This example .BMP generator and ASCII script file reader can be adapted to test code such as pixel drawing algorithms, picture filters, and make use of a source ascii file to drive the inputs of your .sv DUT module while offering logging of the results, and executing the list of commands in order.
